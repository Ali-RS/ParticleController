/**
 * Generates particles from the supplied mesh. A triangle is selected at random
 * and then a random point within that triangle. The particle is then generated
 * with velocity equal to the normal of that face. Note that the normal just
 * looks at the triangle and does not use any information that might be in
 * vertex buffers or normal maps.
 * 
 * This differs from MeshSource in that it scans the geometry and caches the
 * size of each triangle when is is constructed. It then uses those cached values
 * to weight triangle selection so that you have an equal chance to emit a particle
 * from any point on the mesh. Without this areas within large triangles have a
 * smaller chance to emit than areas within small triangles.
 * 
 * The values are scanned and cached both when this is attached and when the method
 * recalculateWeights is called. They are not updated otherwise but in most cases
 * will still be better than a MeshSource even on an animated mesh.
 * 
 * This class will use more memory and CPU time than a MeshSource so should only 
 * be used when required.
